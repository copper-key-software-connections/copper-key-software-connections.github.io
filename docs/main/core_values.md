# Copper Key's Core Values

At my core, I am a [mishmash](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/mishmash) of many different goals, skills, and interests (and you are, too). The ["woo-woo"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/woo-woo) side of me believes that life is, in part, about balancing these incongruent parts within us and finding peace in the acceptance of the whole...  
But the business and practical side of me knows that to get things *done*, focuses have to be set and compromises have to be made. Therefore, when it comes to being the "CuKey Guy", I choose to focus on the following ideals: 
- Efficiency
- Value
- Connections

I elaborate on each below.


## Efficiency
I seek to discover and create more efficient workflows through understanding, documentation, and optimization techniques, identifying your ultimate needs/goals and utilizing off-the-shelf (and possibly custom) software to meet needs/goals.
The engineer in me wants systems to work smoothly and with minimal overhead on the part of us humans, thus providing us with maximum value.
The software developer in me understands why certain choices were made during development and can hypothesize about how certain features work to make full use of them. 
The "connect-the-dots"-er in me likes finding unique puzzles and figuring out the shapes of the pieces and how they best fit together to put the whole picture together. 
Finally, the human whole of me knows that we can't expect ourselves to be 100% efficient for 100% of the time (or really even come close to that), so I try to recognize the limitations of our meat suits and find workarounds to avoid depending on our own motivation and other emotional levels. 

## Value
At each step of the process of helping someone, my goal is to find valuable potential changes/alterations, keeping in mind the costs of the changes as well as the benefits.
Potential costs don't only include monetary fees such as using a more expensive software solution/provider and opportunity costs of losing some features of the current system.
Costs also include the time and mental energy of you and other people learning a new workflow, software system, or mental model, which is not insignificant. 
However, I do my best to identify the low-hanging fruit as quickly as possible, while searching for potential long-term changes/investments that can be made to provide high returns for your business and/or life.
This can vary between a single change in the settings of the software you already use to a complete change of part of your current workflow. Of course, I am much less likely to push the latter unless you are willing to work with me extensively over several weeks to make sure we design it and get it set up to completely and effectively meet your needs.

## Connections
My whole life has been about making connections between things. 
I started to understand the overwhelming need for biodiversity in nature by drawing connections between partial differential equations and simple food chains. 
My first college experience was fueled by making connections with people through shared interests, coursework, and food. 
My current knowledge management workflow is based on a note keeping system called the [Zettlekasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/), which is almost entirely focused on connecting related ideas together to find trains of thought or new ideas that you wouldn't have otherwise considered.
My wife and I have started playing New York Times game [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections), which is an amazing exercise in connecting seemingly unrelated words. 
I believe that the connections within our minds, between individuals, and among organizations are what life is about.
I just happen to have a knack for software.
