# Volunteer Hours

I have volunteer hours at the [Starkville Public Library](https://www.starkville.lib.ms.us/)
each Wednesday from 1pm to 3pm (Central Time).

Some days I may miss this time, but check the [library's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/STKPUBLIB/)
to verify I'll be there.
You can also [contact me](main/contact.md) to ask directly!
