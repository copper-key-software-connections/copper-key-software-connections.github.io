# Tech Tuesday

A "Tech Tuesday" event is when Copper Key comes by your business or organization, brings pastries (e.g. doughnuts), and offers help with technology for some amount of time (about an hour or so). 

🖥️ + 🍩

These events serve multiple purposes, but they are mainly
1) **my chance** to find out what people in our community need and
2) **your chance** to address those annoying little tech issues you've been dealing with!

If you're interested in tech advice/help/discussion and doughnuts (or just the doughnuts), then fill out the form below and I'll be in contact to schedule the event!
