# What is "Copper Key Software Connections"?

My name is Dalton, and I want to help people get more out of their technology usage. 
That's pretty much it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
Having the latest gadget or doodad doesn't matter if you don't know how to use it fully or optimally, 
and that's where I believe I can help.

I have a background in engineering and software, and I believe this leads me to be able to have highly impactful insights into 
your software usage in your business and personal life. 

Do you not have a good grasp on what your options are in using technology? Is there an app for "that"? Is there only one way to do things? Are you searching for alternatives because what you're currently using doesn't work the way you want it to?

On the other hand, do you feel that there are too many options for every choice you make in your digital life? Too many different tools that serve the same or similar purpose? Too many different subscription levels for a single tool? Too many features that you're not sure you need?

I want to help people answer these questions and others so they can get the most value out of their technology usage and have more time for human connections!

<!-- For some examples of what I can help with, please look through my [client stories](client_stories) collection and see if there's anything relevant to you.  -->

Finally, keep in mind that while I am trying to make a living from this business (and also donate to causes like [Starkville Strong](https://www.starkvillestrong.org)), I truly want to help as many people as I can as much as I can; this is why I have [volunteer hours](main/volunteering.md) (and am a really bad salesperson...).
