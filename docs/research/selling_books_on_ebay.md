## Selling Books on eBay

[Post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/s86c0q/selling_books_on_ebay_worth_it/) with useful comments:
- [comment link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/s86c0q/comment/htprl13)
	- mainly about charging shipping separately
	- Buying books in bulk to later sell
- [mention](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/s86c0q/comment/hteednv) of [Media Mail](https://www.usps.com/ship/mail-shipping-services.htm) for cheaper shipping (though takes longer and may need to be inspected)

[Article - Where To Sell Antique Books & Rare Books](https://bookscouter.com/blog/where-to-sell-antique-books-rare-books/)
- value depends on demand, how many copies available, edition, and condition (e.g. has original dust jacket?).
- Lists other sites besides EBay and Abebooks as potential selling points
	- BookScouter.com if has ISBN number (this is a biased recommendation because this article is on the BookScouter.com website...)
	- [RBMS.info](http://rbms.info/yob/): 
		- Several answers to questions you may have about selling rare and important books
		- mentions other places to look at how many copies of a book are on the marke:
			- "abaa.org, addall.com, alibris.com abebooks.com, or vialibri.com"

- To help in creating a listing, you can first select a listing that is similar to a book you own and select "Sell One Like This" button, then edit with your own information.

- Taking Photos of your Book
	- You can use your phone for this, whether or not you are using your phone to make the listings; if you use a computer to make the listings, you can hook your phone up to the computer and drag-drop the files that way (this is usually hard to find the correct images...) or you can just email the photos to yourself and open them on the computer.
- Include Shipping and Return Settings and Pricing
	- Also mentions "Media Mail" to ship singular books
- EBay charges 13.25% + $0.30 on each order

Ironically but predictably, there are apparently [several books](https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Guide-Selling-Ebay-2022/dp/1956047158) on this topic.

- several hours of video, but you could probably filter through and only look at the ones that are relevant to you!


Automation

eBay app apparently can scan barcodes to pull up similar items, or you could take a picture of the item or just upload from your pictures and it will attempt to fill in the listing automatically.

### I want to highlight these parts of the chat
#### 3. **Photo Workflow**
For rare books or anything without a barcode:
- Use your phone camera.
- Set up a **simple photo station** with consistent lighting and a neutral background.
- Take photos in batches: front cover, spine, title page, any damage, back cover.
- Save in folders named after the book title or SKU to keep things organized.

ðŸª„ Automation Tip:
- Use **Google Photos** or **Dropbox Camera Upload** to sync photos from your phone to your computer automatically.
(You could also use iCloud Photos since you have an iPhone, but I don't know if you could keep your space usage to the 5GB that come with the free tier of iCloud)

#### 4. **Templates for Listings**

On **eBay**, use **selling templates** for different types of books:
- One for modern fiction
- One for rare books
- One for textbooks

You can save time by only tweaking a few fields each time.

For **AbeBooks**, they support **bulk upload via spreadsheet** or using tools like HomeBase. These are worth exploring once youâ€™re listing dozens per week.
