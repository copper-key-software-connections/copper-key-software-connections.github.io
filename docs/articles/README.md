## Articles from the CuKey Guy

I find myself often telling people about the same things over and over.
It is to different people every time, but I am still repeating myself.

So, I thought it wise to make a repository of such information so I can share it or use it as a reference at least when giving another rant/ramble. 

I sincerely hope that you can use some of the information here to benefit your life!
If so, and you'd like to have more specific or tailored advice for you particular situation, please [reach out](main/contact.md), [schedule an appointment](https://cal.com/copper-key-software-connections), and/or visit me at my [free hours at the library](main/volunteering.md).
