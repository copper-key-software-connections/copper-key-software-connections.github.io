## Articles from the CuKey Guy

I find myself often telling people about the same things over and over.
It is to different people every time, but I am still repeating myself.

So, I thought it wise to make a repository of such information so I can share it or use it as a reference at least when giving another rant/ramble. 

I sincerely hope that you can use some of the information here to benefit your life!
If so, and you'd like to have more specific or tailored advice for you particular situation, please [reach out](main/contact.md), [schedule an appointment](https://cal.com/copper-key-software-connections), and/or visit me at my [free hours at the library](main/volunteering.md).

I try to understand this word better in this article.

[A primer on keyboard shortcuts](articles/keyboard_shortcuts.md)  
Some may claim keyboard shortcuts are overhyped, but I think we don't encourage people to explore them enough. 
From reducing the time of repetitive tasks to allowing some complex workflows be manageable, shortcuts can help cut down on how much you move your mouse around and give you more time to do your actual job: think. 

[Common Automation Pitfalls](articles/common_automation_pitfalls.md)
I wanted to document some key concerns for when people start wanting to try to automate proceses within their lives and businesses. 
A short list, but some of the ones I find myself often worried about.
