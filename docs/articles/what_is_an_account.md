# What is an "Account"?

Hi again!

I've always wondered about what the word "account" (sometimes also called a "profile"[^profile]) means when talking about software. It's been in the back of my mind for years, though I kind of just accepted that we all mostly understood what was meant by "Facebook account", "Google account", or, more generally, "user account". Recently, I ran into a situation where I was trying to describe what an account was to someone learning to use their smartphone, and I found myself grasping for a coherent description as to how a Facebook account is separate from their phone. This article is an attempt at such an explain. 

The internet (or "world wide web") is essentially a lot of computers that "talk" to each other through the transfer of certain information. How they communicate can be pretty simple or insanely complex, but we really only care about what information is transferred and who it is transferred to. You don't want data that is meant to be sent to you to be sent to some other individual accidentally. So, in a lot of instances, if you are accessing data that's online (meaning you have to use a web browser like Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox, or other to actually see it), you will likely be asked to prove your identity before being able to access the data. For better or worse, there is no centralized identification system that could be used to provide a single point for you to prove yourself to, so every web site (which again is just another computer) has to individually ask you for identifying information (your username and password, for example).

Further, after thinking more about what a bank "account"(link) is (and seeing that there are some even more confusing circular definitions in some [legal contexts](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/social-media-accounts)), I believe the following analogy is useful: 
Think of a user's "account" in some software application as similar to a simple personal bank account in a few main aspects:
- The account is associated with a single entity (a person or organization) that can be uniquely identified in some way.
	- For a bank account, this is the account number to identify the account itself and your personal info (name, SSN, etc.) to prove your own identity.
	- For an online account, this is usually your email address, but can also be a phone number in some cases.
- The account keeps track of certain transactions that occur in relation to the entity, as in a [ledger](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ledger).
	- For a bank account, this is monetary credits and debits.
	- For an online account, this is your posts, comments, direct messages, and other information like values of settings for your account.
- You have to prove your identity to get access to most of the things the account keeps track of.
	- For a bank account, this is when you provide the account number and some form of identification, such as driver's license.
	- For an online account, this is when you enter your username and password (and more recently one-time passcodes, passkeys, and other two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods; see the next article for more details on that).

Basically every online service you use, be it [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), [GroupMe](https://groupme.com/), any bank that does online banking, [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365), online video games, your dentist, ....
they all have some kind of account of your information that you should be able to access.

### If you can't log in to a service
You may not know the login info, but you can usually try the following (in order of ease, typically): 
- If you're just missing the email address and you have multiple email accounts[^email-password], search your email accounts for an email from the company (if you don't know how to search, I'm hoping to have an article describing how to search in different tech contexts soon) to verify which email your account is tied to.
- Use a "Forgot Password?" button if you know your email or other ID used to sign in
- Use a "Forgot email?" (or "Forgot username?") button if it's a special account that has some other personal info in the account, such as SSN, that can be used to identify you. 
- Look up the service provider's website and see if they have a Troubleshooting and/or FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page; look for information about "account access" or "forgot password".
- Look up the service provider's website and see if they have a Customer Service or Contact number; call them and ask what to do.
- If none of those options seem appealing, you can also [contact me](main/contact.md) and I'd be glad to help you!


[^profile]: There is [technically a distinction](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/104712/whats-the-difference-between-account-and-profile), but not much of one to us users; it seems to only matter to the actual technical people making the software.
[^email-password]: Pro-tip: Don't forget or lose the password to your email account, especially if it's your only email account! Email is often the main way to access other accounts, so treat it as if its a lockbox that contains the keys to all your other lockboxes. Don't lose its key!
