Hello, Software Users! (Yes, that means you!)

I've been looking for more words to describe the things that I can help you with, and I came across [this article](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/learning-a-new-program/1/) on [edu.GFCGlobal.org](edu.GFCGlobal.org) (from the [Goodwill Community Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCFLearnFree.org)) that helped me articulate the role I believe I can fill for you.

The article starts with the following hypothetical situation (quoted):

>_You ask a friend who is good with computers to help you do something in a new program. The friend says she hasn't used the program before, but will give it a try. Two minutes later, she's figured out what to do._  
>How did she do that? If you've experienced a situation like the one just described, it might seem like magic. But your friend probably just applied what she knew about computers and computer programs to the program you were trying to use. In this lesson, we'll show you how you can do the same thing.

The article then goes on to explain how you can more confidently use new software programs on your own ("You know more than you think you do!") and different methods to get help when needed. The whole edu.gfcglobal.org website is filled with useful articles to help you learn a variety of topics; I'm probably going to go through their lessons on freelancing soon!

When I started reading just the intro to this article, I realized almost immediately that I am trying to serve as that tech-savvy friend that was able to help you use the software application. You likely already have several friends and/or coworkers you come to for similar situations. So, why would you want to pay someone (or come to my [volunteer hours at the Starkville Public Library](main/volunteering.md)) to help you figure something out? I believe this is because I offer three particularly useful skills:
1. I have experience in such a wide variety of software applications that I likely know several different methods of achieving what you want/need and can help you find the way that works best for you, 
2. I know about the [XY Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem) (see also [this site](https://xyproblem.info/) and the [post that coined the term](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)), and therefore may be able to help find what you actually need to do to solve your problem rather than what you think you need to do, and
3. I have experience with the actual software development process and various relevant technologies, meaning I should be able to troubleshoot and find solutions or workarounds to problems faster than someone without that experience.

All of this knowledge put together leads me to believe that I can add value to your life, and I'd love the opportunity to try! Please contact me [via email](mailto:dalton@copperkeysoftware.com), [by phone](tel:+16625460042), or simply come to the [Starkville Public Library](https://www.starkville.lib.ms.us/) most Wednesdays at 1-3pm and ask about the tech/computer volunteer!
