# "Controlus, Altus, Deletus"

One of the first things you can accidentally do on a computer (aside from use the wrong mouse button) is to press two keys on the keyboard at the same time. Sometimes, this just causes nothing to happen; other times it causes weird things to happen; and still other times, something good happens, and *fast*.  
This can feel like a chaotic kind of magic if you don't understand what's happening.

Would you like to learn about this computer equivalent of magic spells? If so, read on!

### Some example behavior

For instance, on your desktop, with no file selected/highlighted or hovered over, pressing two letter keys (e.g. `Q` and `K`) won't really do anything. If you're in a Word or text document or in a search bar within a browser (basically anywhere with a cursor that has you entering text), pushing two letters at the "same time" will just input those two letters into whatever text-entry location you are currently inside. It could be in either order, but it will be in the actual order you pushed the keys, since the keyboard "talks" to the computer much faster than you can perceive!

What if you accidentally hit the `Alt` and `F4` keys at the same time? If you didn't know better, you may say you broke something on the computer! But really, you just triggered an application "kill switch" that works in a lot of situations. Often, it's used to stop a running application (like a web browser or a video game) when that program is ["hung"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_(computing)) for some reason, so that the computer can reclaim the resources (memory and processor usage) and prevent other applications from being slowed down. Do note that any progress in that application that had not been saved will be lost if you go this route!

Consider another scenario in which you hit the `Ctrl` ("Control") key and the `F` key at the same time (really pressing and holding the `Ctrl` key first before hitting the `F` key). In most contexts, this will open a search box for you to type in some text to search for, even on your desktop in some operating systems (I tested in Ubuntu Linux, but not MacOS or Windows). I discuss this wonderful "Keyboard Shortcut" a little more in the [[article - The Beauty of Searching|article on Searching]]. 

### Keyboard shortcuts, a primer

The last two of the above situations (i.e. `Alt + F4` and `Ctrl + F`) are examples of "Keyboard Shortcuts", combinations of keys you can press on a keyboard that have been designated as "shortcuts" to execute certain behaviors on the computer, such as killing a program, searching for text, creating a new folder/directory, and many other behaviors. 
Usually, the choice of letter is related to the action the shortcut performs, such as:
- `Ctrl + F` meaning "***F*** ind (something)",
- `Ctrl + S` meaning "***S*** ave a file",
- `Ctrl + B` meaning "***B*** old the selected text", and
- `Ctrl + A` meaning "Select ***A*** ll items in the current context"

There are a plethora of shortcuts, and a seemingly even greater number of lists of shortcuts online...
Some of this is just making articles for [clicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait) and advertisement revenue (though those articles can be valuable for new people), but many instances of these articles exist because the same shortcut can mean **different** things in **different** contexts, such as in different programs. Don't assume that `Ctrl + A` always means "Select All". The developer of an application will often list out the available shortcuts in some kind of list somewhere, often in a help section in their documentation or on their website. 

Side note: an alternate name to "keyboard shortcut" is "hotkey". I typically see these as interchangeable, but someone may disagree.

If you want to find useful shortcuts, I would first think about what *small things* you tend to do a lot on your computer: 
- Switch between applications back and forth?
- Open up the same application multiple times a day?
- Copy and paste text?
A lot of times, simple repetitive actions will have a shortcut you can use. 
For the above:
- `Alt + Tab`
- `Windows key (most keyboards)` then enter in name of application`
- `Ctrl + C` (copy) then `Ctrl + V` (paste)

You can find the most useful lists probably via user forums like Reddit ([here's a good list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/22ooxm/hey_reddit_what_are_some_useful_keyboard_shotcuts/)), since the users are more likely to be candid and not just after "clicks". You can also use one of the many LLMs/AIs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.), since they likely know which shortcuts are statistically most likely to be mentioned in their training data, but that training data is potentially heavily influenced by the clickbait articles I mentioned above...
Just assume your mileage may vary. 

#### My top three most used keyboard shortcuts are: 
- `Alt + Tab` to switch between open applications
- `Ctrl + Shift + T` to reopen the last closed tab in a browser
- `Ctrl + Z`, good old faithful, the undo button!

### Conclusion

You can't really go wrong with learning more shortcuts, as long as you actually end up using them (even some of them). 
If you're working on a computer many hours a day, being able to get more done (or the same amount done in less time), can really help you achieve more. 
Saving even just one second on something you do several hundred times a day can get you back ~10 minutes just from that one action. Scaling that up by several different actions and now you've almost claimed back a whole hour. 

Of course, you can make the argument that you could then further automate some of those tasks with some kind of script or whatever, but if you went to that, why are you reading this article?
