# Hello there!
  
Are you hoping to ask someone for help with a specific piece of technology?  
Are you looking for tips on how to use technology in general? 
Do you just want to know what tech tools are available to you? 
Maybe you just want to vent?  
If any of those fit you (or maybe you're just curious), then I think you're in the right place!  
I want can help you with your tech usage. 
For issues big and small, I like to talk about it all!  
If you'll let me, I can be your "key" to success! ðŸ”‘

One quick tip for navigating this and other websites: Use `Alt + <-- (left arrow)` to go backwards to the previous page you were at (and `Alt + --> (right arrow)` to go forwards, but this is used less often).

If you can't see the sidebar to the left (ðŸ‘ˆ), click the menu/"burger" button at the top left of the screen.  
Then you can select what section to go to next.  
Or click one of the links at the top of this page.
